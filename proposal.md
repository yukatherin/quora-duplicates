## Problem Description
Determine if pairs of Quora questions are duplicate. It is interesting to aggregate answers on duplicate questions, and suggest similar questions to users.

## Data
[https://data.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs]
400k pairs, 37% positive

## Methodology/Algorithm
* Primary goals:
   * Baseline: Siamese net with summed GloVe vectors
   * LSTM with attention
* Secondary goals:
   * smart undersampling in the majority class by choosing hard examples in mini-batch allocation [http://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/SMLD/2014/SMLD2014_-_Olivier_Canevet_-_Efficient_mining_of_hard_examples_for_object_detection.pdf]
   * character learning/two-byte encodings

## Related Work

* Rockt√§schel et al. 100D LSTMs w/ word-by-word attention. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06664v1.pdf]

## Evaluation Plan
* F1
* We will produce tuning plots for hyperparameters: 
    * alpha in cross entropy loss to weight positive examples versus negative examples
* We will use cross-validation with F1, look at confusion matrix, error analysis by hand.
